# First, create an index JSON file from all the .usfm files in the current directory
../usfm -d . -o [translation_code]_index.json

# Next, create a single, appended USFM file for the translation
awk '{print $0}' *.usfm > [translation_code].usfm

# Finally, you will need to go through the [translation_code]_index.json file to make 
# sure it's one big index list instead of separate ones. Open the file in vim and run these commands:
:g/}\n{/-1,+8d
:%s/}\(\n     "\)/},\1/g
